    <h1><span class="emoji">🚢</span> Machine Learning on Titanic Disaster <span class="emoji">🌊</span></h1>
    <p>The sinking of the Titanic is a historic event that has been widely studied and analyzed over the years. In recent times, the Titanic dataset has become a popular dataset for machine learning projects, and this project will utilize both Python and Tableau to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.</p>
    <p>In this project, we will use Python for data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection and evaluation. We will utilize popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to perform these tasks. We will also use Tableau to visualize the data and gain further insights.</p>
    <p>The Titanic dataset is a good starting point for beginners who want to learn and practice machine learning techniques. However, it also poses some challenges, such as missing data and imbalanced classes, which will require careful consideration and handling. The use of both Python and Tableau will enable us to effectively address these challenges and develop a comprehensive solution.</p>
    <p>By the end of this project, we will have developed a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict survival rates based on various passenger features. Additionally, we will have gained valuable experience in utilizing both Python and Tableau for machine learning projects. <span class="emoji">🔍🤖</span></p>
